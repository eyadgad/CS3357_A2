# Assignment: Simple Chatroom Application
This repository contains the code template and instructions for a simple chat server and client assignment.

## Assignment Overview

### Task Description

In this assignment, you will implement a basic chat server and client in Python. The server should be able to:

- Accept incoming connections from multiple clients.
- Receive and broadcast messages to all connected clients.
- Manage client connections and disconnections.

The client should be able to:

- Connect to the server.
- Send and receive messages.
- Gracefully exit the chat.

### Directory Structure

This repository is organized as follows:

- `server.py`: Contains the code for the chat server.
- `client.py`: Contains the code for the chat client.

## Instructions

To complete this assignment, follow these steps:

1. **Server Implementation**:
    - Open `server.py`.
    - Implement the required server functions based on the provided guidelines.
    - Ensure error handling and graceful shutdown.

2. **Client Implementation**:
    - Open `client.py`.
    - Implement the required client functions based on the provided guidelines. 
    - Ensure error handling and graceful exit.

3. **Testing**:
    - Test your server and client by running them locally.
    - Ensure that the server can handle multiple client connections and message broadcasting.


## Usage

Provide clear instructions on how to use your server and client code. Include information on how to run them, connect to the server, and interact with the chat.

### Server Usage

```bash
python server.py
```

### Client Usage

```bash
